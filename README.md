# Matlab_Project
Matlab project that checks different objects parameters.
This Matlab program recieves as input data an image with different symetrical and asymetrical objects and shows some objects in different figures.
The first figure shows each object labeled.
The second figure shows the object with the biggest Area and the object with the smallest Perimeter.
The third figure shows the lightest object and the darkest object.
The fourth figure shows the asymetrical objects with a slight margin of 100 pixels, this can be edited(line 176).  
The last figure shows all the objects in the image in descending order.
